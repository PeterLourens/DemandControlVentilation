# Open source demand control ventilation system #
## Introduction
This project is intended as a replacement of the Itho demandflow controller. The reason that this project was started because my controller at home was behaving strange, the transformer and fuse failed and it is expensive to replace. With modern microcontrollers it should be relatively easy to make a controller for such a system. This project is inspired by the orignal Itho controller but not intended to be an exact copy of the Itho controller. 

The basis for this design is:
* Speed of Itho fan can be controlled by either MQTT or HTTP API with settings Low, Medium and High 
* The controller has 12 channels for 12 Itho valves of type DemandFlow Klep (545-7100). The interface is identical.
* This controller can be a 1:1 replacement
* The system must be modular, e.g. it is not required to add the display, a different RTC could be used, the number of sensors can be 
* The software must be open source
* The hardware must be open source

## Hardware design
The hardware design is based on common electronic parts. The basis of the design:
* Microcontroller ESP32-S3 or ESP32. The design is with the ESP32-S3 soldered on the board but one could also choose to install an ESP32 microcontroller through the 30-pin interface
* 74HC595 for multiplication of processor I/O. Each valve has 4 coils to control and therefore 4 outputs are required per valve. In total 48 outputs are required. The 74HC595 are divided in two groups enabling scaling down to 6 valves for smaller houses
* I2C interface for: 
    * up to 16 sensors
    * Display (4x20 characters LCD with I2C backpack)
    * Realtime Clock
* Use of two I2C busses, Wire and Wire1:
    * Wire: Bus 0 sensors and LCD
    * Wire1: Bus1 sensors and RTC
* Connection to sensors through I2C multiplexer (TCA...) enabling the use of I2C sensors with fixed I2C addresses
* Addressable RGB LEDs for status
* Accurate RTC with battery backup because most actions are time based
* Single 15V power supply with on-board 3.3V and 5V convertors (1A capacity each)
* Operation of sensors on 5V or 3.3V. Data communication always on 3.3V
* MOSFET output drivers for low on state resistance. Alternatively ULN2803 could used as well (pin compatible)

### Valve control design
The valves are steppermotors with 4 windings and two windings have a common connection. The stepper motor made by Saia of type UCD2EZ7. The common connection is connected to +15V and the 4 other winding connections are connected with a MOSFET. By turning on the MOSFET, the windings can be individually energised. The winding voltage is 12V and taking a voltage drop over de MOSFET into account, 15V is an appropriate voltage. The circuit of one valve is outlined below. 

<center><img src="images/valve_control_circuit.png" width="50%" height="50%"></center>

Pin 1 of the winding is connected to Q0 of the 74595, pin 2 of the winding is connected to Q1, pin5 to Q2 and pin 6 to Q3. The corresponding pattern to close the valve is  0101, 1001, 1010, 0110. Because the 74595 controls two motors, the pattern for controlling the first motor is  00000101, 00001001, 00001010, 00000110 assuming sending MSB first.

The ESP32 has two circuits to control 2 sets of 3 74595 IC's. Three 74595 can control 6 valves. To control all 6 valves at once, the Shiftout (availble in the Arduino framework, https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/advanced-io/shiftOut/) should be called three time with MSB first for each step of the motor. To reverse the motor the same pattern is used but then in reverse order.

### I2C Design

The controller used both default I2C busses (Wire, Wire1) on custom pins on the EP32(-S3). On controller bus0 is connected to Wire and bus1 is connected to Wire1. Because most sensors have fixed I2C addresses, an multiplexer is required to connect more than one sensor to the same I2C bus. The multiplexer is a TCA9548A, a very common I2C multiplexer. The RTC is connected to bus 0 (Wire) and the LCD to bus1 (Wire1). The multiplexer, LCD and RTC have an adjustable I2C address so this configuration should never lead to an address conflict for devices on the I2C bus.

To set the I2C address of the multiplexers, 6 resistor pad (R./R./R./R./R/R. for bus 0 and R./R./R./R./R/R. for bus 1) are available to solder 0Ohm 0805 size resistors on (or a wire). Refer to the datasheet of the multiplexer: https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tca9548a.pdf. Default is is that the A0,A1,A2 are connected to GND which gives the I2C address of 0x70. This is at the moment hardcoded in the software (globals.h).

Most sensors and other I2C devices have internal pull-up resistors but if this is not the case, the controller has the option to install the pull-up resistors to SDA and SCL. The multiplexer allow also the use of sensors on +5V and 3.3V. The selection is done with a jumper on the controller. There are 4 voltage selection jumpers on the controller and each jumper control the voltage 4 sensors, e.g. bus0, sensors 0,1,2,3.

### Hardware options

The controller has the following hardware options:
* Either ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-16R8N CPU or 30 pins ESP32 module CPU
* LCD display
* External I2C RTC
* Rechargeable 1220 size battery (charging circuit)
* 2 Programmable RGB LEDs
* 2 Programmable pushbuttons

## Software design
The software is written in PlatformIO with the standard Arduino framework for ESP32 and ESP32-S3. Few additional libraries are required for web interface, MQTT, InfluxDB, sensors, RGB LEDS, displays and RTC.

The software uses FreeRTOS functions availabe in the arduino framework. The software is modular because most functions are written as individual tasks. It should be possible to run the software without WiFi connection but with reduced functionaltiy.

The software has the following tasks:
* Task_web - Async webserver for configuration and monitoring of the system
* Task statemach - Statemachine to control different operating mode based on sensor readings or time
* Task influxdb - InfluxDB client for storing sensor data, system operating states and system/debug information 
* Task MQTT - MQTT Client to publish sensor data, system operating states and system/debug information and fan control (option)
* Task Neopixel - Control of 2 RGB LEDs for system status and fan speed
* Task valve control - Control of position of the 12 valves
* Task Wifi - Wifi manager. In the initial setup the ESP32(-S3) will be the access point. Once the Wifi has been configure it will connect to an access point with DHCP or manually configured
* Task I2C - Task to control all I2C devices

The following external  libraries are required:
* ESP32Async/ESPAsyncWebServer
* ESP32Async/AsyncTCP
* ArduinoJson
* DHT20
* adafruit/Adafruit BusIO
* sensirion/Sensirion Core
* sensirion/Sensirion I2C SCD4x
* RTClib
* Ethernet
* HttpClient
* tobiasschuerg/ESP8266 Influxdb
* yiannisbourkelis/Uptime Library
* adafruit/Adafruit NeoPixel

There are two libraries included in the source:
* PubSubClient
* LiquidChristal_I2C

The library LiquidChristal_I2C is fixed to Wire interface. The display is connected to Wire1 and therefore a moficiation to the source file was required and included in the source. The PubSubClient is the original MQTT client written by Nick O'Leary (http://knolleary.net).

## Web interface

### Status interface

This is the root page providing an overview of the sensor readings.

<img src="images/status.png" width="50%" height="50%">

### Settings

Overview of the settings page. Each section of the settings page is detailed below.

<img src="images/settings1.png" width="50%" height="50%">

<img src="images/settings2.png" width="50%" height="50%">

#### Network settings
With empty settings the controller will start as an access point. With a mobile phone or tablet a WIFI connection can be made to "OSVENTILATION-WIFI". Once connected the webinterface can be reached on http://192.168.4.1

To be able to connect the controller to an existing Wifi access point both the SSID and WIFI password must be filled in and the following choice must be made:
* DHCP (default and suitable for most users)
* Manual network configuration

For DHCP mode the dropdown menu must set to "On" (default). If DHCP is set to off then all other field must be filled in order to make a proper manual Wifi connection. If only one DNS server is available then fill the same IP address in for both fields. There is no check on the validity of the filled in data so make sure the data is correct!

Save the settings and reboot the controller with the "Restart ESP32" button.

#### MQTT Settings

Fill in this section to enable and configure MQTT. The default setting is MQTT off with empty settings. The minimum settings are "Enable MQTT" to "On", the MQTT IP address and the base topic <b>(what happens if this is left blank)???</b>. If the MQTT server port is left empty then the default port of 1883 is assumed. 

The settings will become active as soon as the "Save settings" button is pressed. No need to reboot the controller.

#### I2C Settings

In this section the I2C address of both I2C multiplexers are specified. If left empty the default (0x62) is used. If for some reason a different address is chosen by installing resistors R../R../R.. for bus0 or R../R../R.. for bus1 fill in the I2C settings

In these settings the LCD can be enabled and the address can be filled in. If enabled without filling in the I2C address, the default address (0x62) is assumed.

### Valve Control

From this page the valves can be calibrated and controlled. The valves have no means of giving feedback on their position. If the valves are operated beyond their full closed position the connection between the shaft and the rubber will run off the shaft and the valve can't be controlled anymore. If the valve is fully open and operated further open, the device which connects the shaft with the rubber will be pulled out of the rubber and control of the valve is no longer possible. I have not experienced it will damage the valves. The operating range is defined between 0 (fully closed) and 24 (fully open). The valves can only move in steps of 1. This is a design choice and I think there is no necessity for a finer control but it can be done and requires changes to the code.

To keep the valves within their operating range, the position is recorded on the flash storage as a JSON file. The structure is:

{<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"valve0":0,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"valve11":0<br>
}

When the default configuration file is generated all valve position will be zero. If in reality the valve are not in the zero position, one can either remove the rubber and adjust he valves but also this webpage can be used to move the valves to the zero position without storing the positions in the microcontroller. In this way the position of the valves can be calibrated in line with the default file. If, for some reason, the valves need to be moved without losing the calibration, one can als tick the checkbox to store the position in flash. When normal operation then resumes, the valves are also moved back to the position according to the operating mode, see also section "statemachine". This page also has a checkbox to check if the valve operates within in limits when manually moved. The valve will still move but not beyond their limits.

See also commissioning section. When the controller is delivered there is no configuration file yet for the valves. With the button on the page this config file can be created. The settings
