# Open source demand controlled ventilation system #

This project is intended as a replacement of the Itho demandflow controller. The reason that this project was started because my controller at home was behaving strange, the transformer and fuse failed and it is expensive to replace. With modern microcontrollers it should be relatively easy to make a controller for such a system. This project is inspired by the orignal itho controller but not intended to be an exact copy of the Itho controller. 

This 




The basis is open source hardware and software and a modular approach. The basis is that an Itho plenum is installed with valves for each conduit to each room. The fan must be speed controlled with three speed settings. Most people already have a fan from Itho if they fan a Demandflow system. Condition is that the fan must be remote controlled.

TODO:
* Link sensors, valves and location (e.g. bathroom, livingroom, etc.)
* Implement manual high speed state
