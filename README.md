# Open source demand controlled ventilation system #

This project aim to develop a replacement of the Itho demandflow controller. The basis is open source hardware and software and a modular approach. The basis is that an Itho plenum is installed with valves for each conduit to each room. The fan must be speed controlled with three speed settings. Most people already have a fan from Itho if they fan a Demandflow system. Condition is that the fan must be remote controlled.

TODO:
* Link sensors, valves and location (e.g. bathroom, livingroom, etc.)
* Implement manual high speed state
